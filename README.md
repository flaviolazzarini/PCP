These are my Exercises for the Programming and Paradigms Course @ HSLU.

Everything has been written using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com).

## VS Code Extensions
To compile and run everything I had to install a couple of extensions. Following a list of them based on the programming language:

### C
* [C/C++ for Visual Studio Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.cpptools)

### Java
* [Java Extension Pack](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vscjava.vscode-java-pack)

### SWI - Prolog
* [vsc-prolog](https://github.com/arthwang/vsc-prolog)
